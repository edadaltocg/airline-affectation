    "\n",
    "As a pure CSP modelling fails for the larger instance, we will solve it using a combination of CSP and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) modelling. You may refer to past classes with the `PuLP` library for basic usage."

    "An airline operates a given set of flights between pairs of airports. Each flight must be staffed with two pilots and enough cabin crew members depending on the type of aircraft.\n",

    "Each staff member must start its trip from his hometown (not before 12am) and be back home in the evening (before 12am). They must not fly more than a maximum number of flights per day, and more than a maximum amount of time out of home (from first take-off time to last landing time in addition to commuting time).\n",
